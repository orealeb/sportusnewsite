					<p>SportUs is a FREE new app that allows you to efficiently search and join any sport games or recreation activity that is taking place nearby.

In the description section, you can post up the amount of people you are inviting to your activity and more information about the activity. You also have the ability to share a scheduled sport with your friends through your favorite social media platform, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. </p>
